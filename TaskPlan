=========================
Thinking of the architecture:
1) For all provider/source, the first page may has already has enough content. If it was true then the crawl logic could be very simple. Just crawl the pages that matchs some pattern.
2) Two kind of web server, crawl server and public server. Crawl server has source informations and crawl pages, also provide interfact to let administrator edit archives and upload verified content to public server.
3) Content in public server is independent from the crawl server. Means when archive uploaded to public server new 'id' will generated. But there should be a unique guid for each archive. The guid could be digest of the archive content or others. 
4) Generalize the crawler code to abstract the actions. For each source write a child crawler that derived from the general crawler.
